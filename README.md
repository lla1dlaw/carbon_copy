# Carbon Copy 

This project was created to solve a very annoying part of terminal based filesystem interaction: moving files. While UNIX-Like operating systems provide commands like cp and mv for this type of operation, their use relies on knowing 
both the source and destination paths for the file/directory. This project is designed to solve that (and allow me to learn about low level filesystem interactions). 

Written in C, Carbon Copy allows you to copy and paste files and directories with simple commands. Simply provide the path to the asset that you want to copy, move to the directory that you want to paste into, and paste your files!
